## React-Router

Note: Version v4 is still in beta, but is completely redesigned from v3, so we're going to start using it now rather than learn two versions in a row.

Avoid these resources, which are for v3:

* [https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial](v3 Tutorial)

## Firebase

Start here:

* [Firebase Get Started for Web](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)

Skip the [FriendlyChat tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/), as it doesn't actually teach you anything.
